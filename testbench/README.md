Quartus sucks and I could not get this testbed working when launching it from Quartus due to it not adding the paths of the libraries to the do file. ARRRRGH!!!!

If you try to run this testbench from Quartus it will fail.

Anyway to run it open modelsim click on `file->change directory` and change to the directory that this file is in. Then type `do simdo.do` or click on `tools->TCL->execute macro`

It really doesn't surprise me that most people don't use FPGA as the IDEs are really clunky and a very limiting.
